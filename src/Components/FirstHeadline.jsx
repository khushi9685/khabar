                Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” was on Monday sworn in
                 as the Prime Minister of Nepal for a third time, a day after the former guerrilla leader dramatically walked out of the pre-poll alliance led by the Nepali Congress and joined hands with opposition leader K P Sharma Oli.

       The 68-year-old CPN-Maoist Centre chairman was appointed as the country’s new 
   prime minister
       on Sunday after he submitted a letter to President Bidya Devi Bhandari showing the support of
        169 members in the 275-member House of Representatives.
